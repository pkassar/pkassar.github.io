#### Resume website
Project inspired by [Prof Rossetti](https://prof-rossetti.org/) as part of the Georgetown MBA class Internet Business Technologies.

Project created with inspiration from the following Bootstrap template [https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume/](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume/)


#### Website Creation

##### 1) Planning
Applying to technology related jobs and having a background in software development I've always wanted to take the time and create a personal website higlighting my professional and academic experiences with some extra flair to showcase my musical interests.

I needed at least four sections:
  1)Education
  2)Resume bullet points
  3)Music
  4)Link to my linkedin and current resume

##### 2) Designing

Here attached the initial drawing of the site I had in mind, I later amended the HTML architecture and flagged some of the content for a potential V2 in the future.

I started planning four pages or sections to feature on my page and used the[Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume/) to create the website. I thought having the navbar on the side was judicious for putting emphasis on the content.


##### 3) Implementation
I initially had issues deploying the site on my github page but later found that moving the index.html folder to root would solve my issue


##### Special thanks
Lucas Tcheyan for his help throughout the process, discussing content and selecting sections to highlight.
